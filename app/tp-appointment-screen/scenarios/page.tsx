              Dr. Agent is not just an AI assistant — it{"'"}s an <strong>AI co-pilot for doctors</strong> embedded directly into the TatvaPractice EMR workflow.
              It sits alongside the prescription pad (RxPad) and provides real-time, context-aware clinical intelligence during patient consultations.

                  Traditional EMRs need doctors to navigate multiple screens. AAGUI embeds AI into existing UI surfaces — every card, sidebar section, and header becomes an AI touchpoint. AI is part of the interface, not a separate chat window.

                  Bidirectional: AI generates structured outputs (cards, charts) that render natively in the EMR. Doctor interactions (pills, sidebar clicks, copy-to-RxPad) feed context back. The doctor never leaves their workflow.

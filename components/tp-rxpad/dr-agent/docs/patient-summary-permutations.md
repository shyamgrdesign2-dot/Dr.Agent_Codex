# Patient Summary — Data Permutations & Structuring

## Overview

The Patient Summary card is the most complex card in the system. Its content is entirely driven by available data — and the data availability varies wildly across patients. This document defines every permutation, what gets shown, what gets hidden, and what fallback text to use.

## 2. Four Fundamental Permutations

### P1: New Patient, No History, Symptoms Only (`apt-zerodata` — Ramesh M)

**Available:** Symptom collector data only (self-reported symptoms, self-declared allergies, self-declared meds)
**Missing:** Vitals, labs, last visit, chronic conditions, family history, concern trends

**Patient Summary Structure:**

```

**Agent intro text:** "This is Ramesh M's first visit. I don't have any prior clinical records. Here's what he reported during intake."

**Key rules:**
- Show "First Visit" badge or "New Patient" tag
- Symptom collector data is the PRIMARY content
- Mark all self-reported data as "(self-reported)" since it's unverified
- Do NOT show empty sections (no "Vitals: —", no "Labs: —")
- Canned pills focus on initial workup

### P2: Returning Patient, History Only, No Symptoms (`reg-suresh` — Suresh Nair)

**Available:** Full history (vitals, labs, last visit, chronic conditions, meds, allergies, family history, concern trend)
**Missing:** Symptom collector data (patient did not fill intake form)

## 4. Agent Intro Text Patterns

The agent generates a text message ABOVE the patient summary card. This text adapts to the available data:

### Pattern: New Patient, No History
```
"This is [Name]'s first visit. No prior clinical records are available.
Here's what [he/she] reported during intake."
```
Followed by: `patient_summary` card (P1 layout)

### Pattern: Returning Patient, No Intake
```
"[Name] is here today. [He/She] hasn't filled the symptom collector.
Here's [his/her] clinical snapshot from available records."
```
Followed by: `patient_summary` card (P2 layout)

### Pattern: Returning Patient, With Intake + Critical Vitals
```
"[Name] is back with [primary symptom]. Vitals are concerning — [flagged vitals].
[He/She] has [N] flagged labs and [trend description]."
```
Followed by: `patient_summary` card (P3 layout)

### Pattern: Returning Patient, With Intake + Normal Vitals
```
"[Name] presents with [primary symptom]. Vitals are within normal range.
[Context: overdue follow-up / flagged labs / specialty note]."
```
Followed by: `patient_summary` card (P3/P4 layout)

### Pattern: Returning Patient, Routine Follow-up
```
"[Name] is here for a routine follow-up. Last visit was [date].
[Summary of what was done last time and what's due]."
```
Followed by: `patient_summary` card (P2 layout)

---

## 5. Short Summary vs Full Summary

### Short Summary (used in: Patient tooltip, appointment card preview)

One-liner format: `"[Conditions] patient, on [key meds], last visited [date] with [chief complaint], [key finding]."`

Generated from: `patientNarrative` + `chronicConditions[0..2]` + `activeMeds[0..2]` + `lastVisit.date` + `lastVisit.diagnosis`

**If no history:** `"New patient with [self-reported symptoms]. [Allergy note]."`
**If no symptoms:** `"Returning patient with [conditions]. Last visit [date], [diagnosis]."`

### Full Summary (used in: patient_summary card)

Multi-section card with all available data. See Section 2 for layouts.

## 5A. Patient Tooltip Summary — Structure & Formulation

### Overview

On the appointment listing page, hovering over the AI icon shows a **short patient summary tooltip** (`AiPatientTooltip`). This is a concise, one-paragraph clinical snapshot designed for quick context before the doctor opens the consult. The tooltip is tab-aware — queue tab shows clinical summary text, while other tabs (finished, cancelled, draft, pending-digitisation) show structured data.

### Component Architecture

```
AiPatientTooltip (portal-based)
├── Header: AI spark icon + "Dr. Agent" gradient text
├── Content: tab-aware rendering
│   ├── Queue tab → summary text (from PATIENT_TOOLTIP_SUMMARIES)
│   ├── Finished tab → structured: Came for, Diagnosed, Prescribed, Ordered, Follow-up
│   ├── Cancelled tab → structured: Reason, Cancelled at, Notes
│   ├── Draft tab → checklist: Symptoms, Diagnosis, Medications, Advice, Investigations, Follow-up
│   └── Pending Digitisation → structured: Admitted, Status, Pending items
└── Footer: "Click to open Dr. Agent →"
```

### Queue Tab — Summary Text Formula

The `PATIENT_TOOLTIP_SUMMARIES` record stores pre-generated one-liner summaries keyed by patient ID. In production, these would be AI-generated from the patient's `SmartSummaryData`. The formula varies by data availability:

#### Formula A: Returning Patient + Symptoms + History (richest)

**Template:**
```
"Patient with {chronicConditions[0..2]}, on {activeMeds[0..2]},
 last visited on {lastVisit.date} with {lastVisit.symptoms},
 diagnosed {lastVisit.diagnosis},
 suggested {activeMeds[0..1] or suggestedMeds}."
```

**Data sources:**
- `chronicConditions` → first 2-3 conditions with duration
- `activeMeds` → first 2-3 key medications with dosage
- `lastVisit.date` → formatted as "DD Mon'YY"
- `lastVisit.symptoms` → chief complaints (shortened)
- `lastVisit.diagnosis` → primary + secondary diagnoses
- `symptomCollectorData.suggestedMeds` → fallback for suggested meds

**Example (Shyam GR):**
> "Patient with Hypertension 3yr and Diabetes Mellitus 2yr, on Telma 20mg, last visited on 27 Jan'26 with fever, diagnosed Viral fever and Conjunctivitis, suggested Paracetamol 650mg and Azithromycin 500mg."

#### Formula B: Returning Patient + History Only (no symptom collector)

**Template:**
```
"Patient with {chronicConditions[0..2]}, on {activeMeds[0..2]},
 last visited {lastVisit.date}, {lastVisit.diagnosis},
 {concernTrend or keyLabs highlight}."
```

**Data sources:**
- Same as Formula A but without `symptomCollectorData`
- `concernTrend` → if declining trend exists, append metric + value
- `keyLabs` → fallback: mention highest-priority flagged lab

**Example (Neha Gupta — no symptom collector):**
> "Patient with Bronchial Asthma since childhood and Hypothyroidism 3yr, on Budecort 200mcg and Thyronorm 50mcg, last visited 18 Feb'26 with nocturnal cough, diagnosed Acute exacerbation of asthma, SpO2 trending down (96%)."

**Example (Suresh Nair — no symptom collector):**
> "Patient with IHD post-angioplasty (2024), HTN 5yr, on Clopidogrel 75mg, Atorvastatin 40mg, last visited 10 Feb'26, stable IHD, LDL 118 (above target)."

#### Formula C: New Patient + Symptoms Only (no history)

**Template:**
```
"New patient with {symptoms[0..2]} {duration}.
 Allergy: {allergies}. On {currentMedications[0..2]}."
```

**Data sources:**
- `symptomCollectorData.symptoms` → first 2-3 symptoms with duration
- `symptomCollectorData.allergies` → self-reported allergies
- `symptomCollectorData.currentMedications` → self-reported current meds

**Example (Ramesh M):**
> "New patient with Knee Pain and Morning Stiffness 1 week. Allergy: Sulfonamides, on Vit D3 60K (weekly)."

#### Formula D: No Data Available

**Template:**
```
"New patient. No prior clinical data or symptom reports available."
```

This case occurs when a walk-in patient has neither filled the symptom collector NOR has any historical records. The tooltip should still be shown but with minimal text.

### Data Availability → Formula Mapping

| Has History | Has Symptom Collector | Formula | Example Patient |
|-------------|----------------------|---------|-----------------|
| Yes | Yes | A (richest) | Shyam GR, Anjali, Vikram, Priya, Arjun, Lakshmi |
| Yes | No | B (history-only) | Neha Gupta, Suresh Nair |
| No | Yes | C (symptoms-only) | Ramesh M |
| No | No | D (minimal) | (theoretical — no demo patient) |

### Text Highlighting

The `highlightSummaryText()` function applies bold styling to clinical terms within the summary text:

**Highlighted patterns (via regex):**
- **Dates:** `DD Mon'YY` format (e.g., "27 Jan'26") and `DD-MM-YYYY`
- **Conditions:** Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Dyslipidemia, Hypothyroid, PCOS, Migraine, URTI, AUB, Primigravida, Pre-Diabetes
- **Medications:** Telma, Metsmall, Paracetamol, Azithromycin, Sumatriptan, Naproxen, Vitamin D, Rosuvastatin, Melatonin, CoQ10, Thyronorm, Folic Acid, Calcium, Amoxicillin, Salbutamol, Autrin, Tranexamic acid, Iron+Folic (with optional numeric suffixes)

**Rendering:** Matched terms are wrapped in `<span className="font-semibold text-tp-slate-700">` for visual emphasis within the `text-tp-slate-500` body text.

### Symptom Collector Icon on Appointment Page

The appointment listing shows a green virus icon (`hasSymptoms: true`) next to the visit type ONLY for patients who have filled the symptom collector (i.e., have `symptomCollectorData` in their mock data). This icon:
- Indicates pre-visit intake data is available
- Has tooltip: "Symptoms collected — Click to view"
- Clicking opens Dr. Agent panel for that patient

**Consistency rule:** `hasSymptoms === true` on the appointment row ↔ `symptomCollectorData` exists in `SMART_SUMMARY_BY_CONTEXT`. If the icon is absent, opening Dr. Agent shows Patient Summary directly (not Patient Reported card).

### Production AI Integration Notes

In production, the tooltip summary would be generated by an AI model with this structured prompt:

```
Given the following patient data, generate a concise one-paragraph clinical summary
(max 2 sentences, under 200 characters) for a doctor's quick reference tooltip.

Input schema:
- chronicConditions: string[]     // e.g. ["Hypertension (3yr)", "Diabetes (1yr)"]
- activeMeds: string[]            // e.g. ["Telma20 1-0-0-1", "Metsmail 500"]
- lastVisit: { date, symptoms, diagnosis }
- keyLabs: { name, value, flag }[]
- concernTrend: { label, values, tone }
- symptomCollectorData?: { symptoms, allergies, currentMedications }
- isNewPatient: boolean

Rules:
1. Lead with chronic conditions if returning patient, or "New patient" if first visit
2. Include 1-2 key medications
3. Reference last visit date and primary diagnosis
4. If concern trend exists, mention it last
5. Bold-worthy terms: condition names, medication names, dates
6. Do NOT include patient name (shown separately in UI)
```

## 6. Homepage Intro Message Structure

When the doctor opens the homepage (no patient selected), the agent shows:

1. **Text intro** (chat bubble): Greeting + daily context
   ```
   "Good morning, Dr. Sharma! You have [N] patients queued today.
   [N] follow-ups are overdue — [names].
   [Patient name] has [N] new flagged lab values since last visit.
   [N] draft prescriptions are pending your review."
   ```

2. **Welcome Card**: Today's schedule with neutral stat boxes (Queued, Follow-ups, Drafts, Finished)

3. **Canned Pills**: View Queue, Pending follow-ups, Revenue overview, Review drafts
